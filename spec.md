# Gitmoji

Gitmoji is a specification for commit message and annotation format.
Emoticons are used to classify revisions into a category, providing convinient graphical elements to identify the purpose of the revision quickly at first sight.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## The commit message

1. The commit message consists of REQUIRED title, OPTIONAL body providing additional description if convinient and OPTIONAL trailer, providing key-value metadata.

```
<title>

[optional body]

[optional trailers]
```

### The message title

Scheme: `<emoji> <description>`

1. The first line of commit message (the title) MUST begin with an emoji symbol, followed by a REQUIRED single space and REQUIRED description.
1. The emoji symbol SHOULD be inserted as a single unicode character (e.g. üêõ), however, the repository MAY use code notation `:bug:`. The repository SHOULD use consistent notation.
1. More than one emoji symbol MUST NOT be used to categorize the commit and the title SHOULD NOT contain additional emoji symbols.
1. The title length SHOULD NOT exceed 50 characters in length, which leaves 48 characters for message using unicode notation and 44 for `:bug:` title using the text notation.
1. The title MUST be capitalized, MUST be a single sentence in imperative form, MUST NOT end with a dot and SHOUD be in English language.
1. The title SHOULD describe the changes to the best abilities of the author and SHOULD not duplicate information provided by the emoji symbol.

### The message body

1. The body MAY contain any characters including newline, but SHOULD be in English language and SHOULD contain only ASCII characters.
1. Each line of the body SHOULD be less or equal to 72 characters, unless there is a special reason for it (e.g. quoting text, long urls).
1. If the revision introduces changes that seem to need additional context or explanation, the author SHOULD add a commit description.
1. The body SHOULD NOT contain generated content and if changes are trivial or obvious, the body SHOULD be ommited.

### The message trailers

Scheme: `<key>[: <value>]`

1. The trailers MAY be used to contain machine readable metadata.
1. Each line MUST have a key.
1. Each line MAY have a value. In this case the key is followed by a REQUIRED colon, REQUIRED space and a value.

### Issue tracker references

1. If an issue from tracker is referenced, author should use `References` key.

### Special commits

1. Commits with default messages generated by git, SHOULD NOT follow the rules described in this section. This applies to commits generated by `git revert`, `git merge` (author SHOULD keep the generated message) and `git cherrypick` (author SHOULD keep the original commit message regardless of the convention used).
